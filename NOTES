ddns-cli - syntax proposal
--------------------------

Replace all existing records of the same type with a new one
(I.e. setting an IPv4 address will not touch any IPv6 addrs
or other records like MX)
For IPv4 and IPv6 addresses try to set up reverse mapping as well
unless --no-reverse is used.
Also try to wipe the old reverse record, e.g. when changing and IP from
192.0.2.1 to 192.0.2.100 it will attempt to delete 1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.
unless --keep-old-reverse is used. This is also implied by --no-reverse.

	[--set] [--type A] 192.0.2.1 host.example.com
	[--set] [--type AAAA] 2001:dc0:1234::1 host.example.com
	[--set] --type NS ns1.example.com example.com
	[--set] --type MX 1 mail.example.com example.com

Add new record of a given type, do not delete the existing ones.
For IPv4 and IPv6 addresses try to set up reverse mapping as well
unless --no-reverse is used.

	--add [--type A] 192.0.2.1 host.example.com
	--add [--type AAAA] 2001:dc0:1234::1 host.example.com
	--add --type NS ns2.example.com example.com
	--add --type MX 2 mail.example.com example.com

Delete a record

	--delete [--type {any,A,AAAA,MX,NS,...}] [--no-reverse] host.example.com

List all the records, optionally filter by a given type

	--list [--type {A,AAAA,MX,...}] example.com
